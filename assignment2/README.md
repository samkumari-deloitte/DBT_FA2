## Milestone 1 

## Question 1 : Calculate Monthly average NAV, Repurchase & Sale Price for each scheme.

I've grouped the data according to month of nav_date column. Then I calculated the avergaes required in the question for each group.

## Question : 2.	Find out each schemeâ€™s Max and Min NAV value and Date it occurred

I grouped data by the code column and found the max and min nav values for each group. I tried to figure out the date column, But it was creating some errors.

## Milestone 2

## Question 1 : Mutual fund performance - including YTD, MTD, 1 Year and Since Inception returns

Here, We have to calculate YTD, MTD and Overall percentages. I used three different queries to find YTD, MTD and overall percentages. I grouped the data by code and year in the case of YTD. Then I calculated the maximum and minimum date for each code in every year using subqueries. After that I found out the starting and ending nav on those maximum and minimum dates and lastly, I used the formula given to us to calculate the percentage change. 

I repeated the similar steps for calculating MTD. I just grouped there by code and month. 

For calculating the overall (since inception) percentage, I grouped the whole data by code only and repeated the previous steps. 

1. YTD

2. MTD

3. Overall (Since Insception)

### Questionn 2 : Plot performance of upto 3 funds for the past 3 months 

I used the same logic as in the above question. But in this question I ran the query for three codes oonly. I used snowflake charts to plot the results too. 

1. YTD

2. MTD

3. Overall

### Q3 : List of mutual funds which were discontinued in a given year

I created a column a last_present_year. If the last_present_year for a code is 2018. That means it is discontinued in 2019. I used group by code to find max dates for each codes. Then etracted it's year part for last_present_date. Then I joined nav_history table with mutual fuds table to extract the fund's name. At last, I used a where condition to filter 2018 data. In such way almost 157 mutual funds were discontinued in 2018.

### Q4 : Weekly, monthly and ytd results for all funds in liquid fund category 

I used to same logic as used in Q1. For weekly percentage I grouped by week(nav_date) and code. Then I joined the table nav_history with mutual funds and category table. At last I used a where condition to filter out only Liquid categories. 


1. Weekly

2. MTD

3. YTD

### Question 5 : Best and worst performing fund in a given category on the basis of 1 year returns 

I used the sale_price to calculate the overall returns. I assumed that whichever mutual fund is getting the maximum sum of sale price is the best performing. And the opposite is worst performing mutual fund. According to question, I added a actegory flter using where condition that finds the best and worst funds in a particular category. In my case I used the category Liquid. So the queries will return best and worst performing funds in liquid category. 

1. Best

2. Worst
